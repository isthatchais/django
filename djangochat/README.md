# Overview
This is my first attempt at making a django app. I set out to build a chat app using django.  I had a lot of fun with this project unfortunatly 
I got stuck trying to get the websocket to work properly. I think the problem may have come from a using a newer version of django than most of the tutorials.
I batteled this problem for 2 weeks and in the end I was not able to overcome. I will be working on this later.

This is a link to a video I made going over the code

# Web Pages

I created a project that has several pages it has a welcome page, a log in page, a create user page, and multpile chat pages, There is also a admin page

# Development Environment

I used django, channels, vs code, chrome, and firefox

django uses python with some cool libraries and functionality making it very nice for creating users, log ins etc.
